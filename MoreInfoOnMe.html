<h1><b>Hey! So, this is what I like, and what I usually do.
Essentially, what makes me a person.</b></h1>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>Music is definitely a massive part of my life. I've played it forever now, and I listen to it every single day. While I heavily lean towards Japanese Music, if it has great acoustics, lyrics, and singers usually I would be into it.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNs3VC8B9ac">I didn't want to fly in the blue sky.</a> This song is by Kumagawa Miyu, an artist who recently rebranded as "Myuk". Her music is greatly underrated and underappreciated, as she has an incredibly beautiful voice, paired with a wonderful guitar acoustic.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9y6y7uo5Z8">Hien.</a> A rather simple song by a famous singer, Yonezu Kenshi. Push forward, no matter how harsh the winds may be, and fly through.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VKIqrvVOpo">Just a sunny day for you.</a> To be completely honest, this song hits close to home. It's about someone who chases after their love, only to realize they both have grown up, and their youth is far behind them. Summer is over, and we have to move on. Yorushika's music usually have the theme of summer, and this is no exception.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEt_poMSw_U">Torches.</a> Sung by Aimer, this song conveys life as a ship, sailing through difficult times. Always keep your torches aflame and break through the darkest of storms.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnSqHlG8Ucg">What never changes.</a> Last but not least is the things that never change. I actually sang this song during my graduation, as it leans towards how we really would love things to stay the same, but as we graduate, we can't control what happens next. It was a farewell to highschool, and someone I used to love.</li>


</ul>
<h2>Reading and Writing</h2>
<p> To be honest, explaining this is difficult. I read a little of anything and everything, never really being confined to one specific niche or genre. As of late however, I have been reading more light novels. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Percy Jackson and the Olympians: Something I read growing up, and just an amazing story overall.</li>
    <li>George Orwell's 1984: I got bored one day and read it in my school library. The messages it has about our future are really things to think about.</li>
    <li>Anything by Roald Dahl, although Boy is a personal bias.</li>
    <li>Komi-san Can't Communicate: Just a pretty fun read for a light laugh and romance.</li>
	<li>JoJo's Bizzare Adventure (Steel Ball Run): While the premise may be bizzare, it is one of the most entertaining stories I have read in a while, in terms of storytelling, worldbuilding, and character development.</li>
    <li>Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species: Once again, I got bored and read this. It is, in a sense, a textbook, so I was just pretty interested in what it had.</li>
    <li>Blue Lock: I hate soccer, I barely played when I was young, because I was bad. When there was a story about soccer, I was not interested in the slightest. However, reading it now, it does have a really fascinating message. Sometimes in life, let your ego take over. Do the things for yourself, and don't rely on someone else. Pretty great read.
</ul>
<p> As for writing, I shamefully admit I have not been keeping up. The things I write have to be perfect, and while I will continue practicing, I cannot release anything I feel is short of perfection. However, one thing I can say is that the things I write aim to create a hole within the readers heart, something that they will not forget in a long time. These stories usually will have distance and longing as a major factor, inspired my one of my favorite directors, Makoto Shinkai.</p>

<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p> There is really no point in denying it, I have become a bit of a video game addict recently. This list sums it up.
<ul>
	<li>Valorant: A tactical 5v5 shooter that is simply addicting. While I am still relatively new to the game, improving is something I would like to do.
    <li>Subnautica: An underwater, survival, open-world craft horror game that I think is one of the best and the most revolutionary. It pushes the boundaries of what you can do with video games, and I think it is a step forward towards something special.</li>
    <li>Identity V: This game is an assymetrical 1v4 horror, where one player is a "hunter" and four are "survivors" trying to escape. While the game balancing is horrendous, it is somewhat fun if played from time to time.
    </li>Genshin Impact: Saved the most aggravating for last, though Identity V is arguably worse. This nothing but a late game grind is somehow addictive thanks to its gacha system, where you pull for new characters each patch. It is terrible, but I come back to it anyways.
</ul>

<h2>Films and TV Shows</h2>
<p> Last would be my favorite movies and TV shows.</p>
<ul>
	<li> Mob Psycho 100: It may sound strange, but this show has a lot going for it in terms of everything. It has so many great messages. If you're here for flashy fight scenes, then keep going, but expect to cry as well. The development the characters go through, especially Mob (the main character) is amazing. You don't have to live by what you're born with, live life the way you want, your life is your own. Loved this show.
    <li> Inception: A dream within a dream, within a dream. What ideas are truly our own, and how can someone plant an idea within us? Mind blowing storytelling, direction, and overall just a must watch, insane movie.</li>
    <li> Steins Gate: This show is not what you would expect it to be. Despite having a slow start, it has one of the biggest payoffs later on. A time travel story that shows you your actions have consequences, and even with the power of a god, you can't have everything in the world.
</ul>

<h2>Closing</h2>
Well, I hope that gave some insight to what I like. Thanks for the read!
